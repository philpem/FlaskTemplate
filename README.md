# FlaskTemplate

A simple Flask+SQLAlchemy application template.

## TODO:

- Database migration isn't handled... at all. Ideally this template should be updated to use something like Alembic.
- The Docker bootstrap code isn't ideal (especially database initialisation). Ideally look at Dockerfiles for other web apps and improve this.
